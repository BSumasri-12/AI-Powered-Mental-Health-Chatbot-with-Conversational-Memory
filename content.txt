Healthy Ways to Manage Stress:

1. Deep Breathing:
Practice slow, deep breathing for a few minutes. This helps calm the nervous system and reduce anxiety.

2. Mindfulness and Meditation:
Mindfulness helps you stay present. Meditation for even 5–10 minutes a day can reduce stress levels.

3. Physical Activity:
Exercise such as walking, yoga, or stretching releases endorphins that improve mood and reduce stress.

4. Proper Sleep:
Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep. Avoid mobile phones before bedtime and maintain a regular sleep schedule.

5. Time Management:
Break tasks into smaller steps and prioritize important work to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

6. Healthy Diet:
Eat balanced meals and drink enough water. Reduce caffeine and junk food intake.

7. Express Your Feelings:
Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor can help release emotional stress.

8. Relaxation Activities:
Listening to music, reading, drawing, or spending time in nature can help refresh the mind.

When to Seek Professional Help:
- Stress lasts for several weeks
- Feeling hopeless or emotionally numb
- Panic attacks or extreme anxiety
- Thoughts of self-harm

Remember:
You are not alone. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Small daily habits can make a big difference in mental health.
